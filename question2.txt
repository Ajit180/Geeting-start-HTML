In HTML, comments are used to include notes or annotations within the code that are not displayed on the web page. They serve the purpose of providing information to developers or anyone who reads the code, helping them understand the structure, purpose, or details of specific sections of the HTML document. Comments are ignored by web browsers and do not affect the appearance or functionality of the web page. They are enclosed between <!-- and --> tags in HTML.
