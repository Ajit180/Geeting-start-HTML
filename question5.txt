The Document Type Declaration (DOCTYPE) in HTML is a declaration placed at the beginning of an HTML document to specify the version of HTML or XML being used. 
It helps browsers interpret the document correctly by indicating its type and version. In HTML5, the DOCTYPE declaration is simplified to `<!DOCTYPE html>`, making it easier to specify the document type.
