    <p>You have to believe in yourself when no one else does,
        The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams

    <p>For me, becoming isn't about arriving somewhere 
        or achieving a certain aim. I see it instead as
         forward motion, <br>a means of evolving, a way to reach continuously 
         toward a better self. The journey doesnt end.</p>
